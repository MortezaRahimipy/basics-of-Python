Hello, I'm Morteza Rahimi.
This repo is about basics of Python.Please read and see file based on the number at the beginning of each file name.
This repo isn't complete source and it's only about very basic things.
So it's good and necessary to visit [python](https://www.python.org/) and read Python Documentation.
